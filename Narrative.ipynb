    "\n",

    "\n",
    "I want to possibly incorporate that into our report in the concluding sections by saying something to the effect of : “If we chose a finer granularity such as cities rather than counties the linear regression model may have yielded better results”  \n",
    "\n",
    "I will phrase it more scientifically and eloquently for the actual report of course and only after getting your input as to what you may want these potential types of sentences to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2: What types of information does the CDP dataset bring to our project?  What does the municipality's dataset bring?**  \n",
    "Also does what location types fall under the umbrella of municipalities (i.e. what location types does this dataset contain: villages, boroughs, towns, and/or cities?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3: How did we determine that all the locations of death data were in connecticut?**  \n",
    "Did you use the latitude, longitude data to sort the locations into their respective towns/cities and then their counties?\n",
    "I remember you did some mapping technique which would be cool to talk about and add more meat to the methods section of the report.\n",
