A \"Y\" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected.\n\nData are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation.\n\nThe \u201cMorphine (Not Heroin)\u201d values are related to the differences between how Morphine and Heroin are metabolized and therefor detected in the toxicity results. Heroin metabolizes to 6-MAM which then metabolizes to morphine.  6-MAM is unique to heroin, and has a short half-life (as does heroin itself). Thus, in some heroin deaths, the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as \u201cMorphine (not heroin).\u201d  Therefor, the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine, but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated.\n\n \u201cAny Opioid\u201d \u2013 If the Medical Examiner cannot conclude whether it\u2019s RX Morphine or heroin based morphine in the toxicity results, that column may be checked", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/rybz-nyjw/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "text/csv"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/rybz-nyjw/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "application/rdf+xml"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/rybz-nyjw/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "application/json"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/rybz-nyjw/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD", "mediaType": "application/xml"}], "identifier": "https://data.ct.gov/api/views/rybz-nyjw", "issued": "2019-05-05", "keyword": ["death", "drug", "overdose", "heroin", "opioid", "substance abuse"], "landingPage": "https://data.ct.gov/d/rybz-nyjw", "modified": "2019-05-05", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "data.ct.gov"}, "theme": ["Health and Human Services"], "title": "Accidental Drug Related Deaths 2012-2018"}
