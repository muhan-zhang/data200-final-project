#### A note on Attribution 
One thing to note on the usage of this dataset is the importance of attribution.  There were several paid options for accessing this dataset and there was also a free/basic version.  Since the free/basic version of the database will be used in the project, we must link back to that same page with link https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities to meet the attribution requirement stipulated on that webpage.  Essentially, citing our sources and giving credit to the creators of the dataset.
See the Frequently Asked questions section and specifically the question "If I use the free database, what type of attribution is required?" for more information on attribution requirements.
